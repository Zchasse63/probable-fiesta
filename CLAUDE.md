# Project Instructions

## Zeroshot Tasks

When working with Zeroshot (running clusters, monitoring tasks, writing prompts, or troubleshooting), always read and follow the guidance in .claude/skills/zeroshot/SKILL.md first. Reference the files in .claude/skills/zeroshot/references/ for detailed information on:

- Installation and setup: references/installation.md
- Monitoring clusters: references/monitoring.md
- Writing effective prompts: references/prompting.md
- Troubleshooting issues: references/troubleshooting.md

Before running any `zeroshot run` command, review the prompting guide to ensure the task is well-scoped.
